                <p>My name is Jing and I am a full time accountant in a construction company as well as a student in UW
                    Coding Boot Camp. I've been learning web development programming languages for two weeks and trust
                    me you won't believe how much I've learned. I am so happy to have coding as a part of my life and I
                    am looking
                    forward to learning more!</p>
                <p>I am a daughter of great parents, a wife of an awesome husband, and a mommy of two beatiful bird
                    sons. I love traveling, cooking, birding and gardening. The biggest adventure that I've done was
                    traveling to eleven countries, twenty two cities across four continents in two months. I grew up in
                    China, went to study and got married in Australia and now I settled in Seattle. Summer is coming,
                    can't wait to go out and enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š </p>
